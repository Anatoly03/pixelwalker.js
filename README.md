## Events: Receive

| Event | Data | Description |
|:-:|-|-|
| `init` | `id`, `cuid`, `username`, `face`, `isAdmin`, `x`<sup>1</sup>, `y`<sup>1</sup>, `can_edit`, `can_god`, `title`, `plays`, `owner`, `width`, `height` | Client joined the room. **Do not use unless intentional. Instead use `start`, which is compatible with the bindings!** |
| `start`<sup>2</sup> | `id` | Client joined the room after init. |
| `error`<sup>2</sup> | `err` | Called on API errors |
| `updateRights` |  | |
| `worldMetadata` |  | |
| `worldCleared` |  | |
| `chatMessage` |  | |
| `cmd:*`<sup>2</sup> | `id`, ...`args` | Retrieve specific commands from messages. Replace `*` with command to listen to. For `!ping`, the event is `cmd:ping`. Arguments are provided by the player in chat. You can access `client.cmdPrefix` to set a list of allowed command prefices. |
| `systemMessage` |  | |
| `playerJoined` |  | |
| `playerLeft` |  | |
| `playerMoved` |  | |
| `playerFace` |  | |
| `playerGodMode` |  | |
| `playerModMode` |  | |

| `placeBlock` |  | |
| `crownTouched` |  | |
| `keyPressed` |  | |
<!-- | `coinCollected`<sup>2</sup> | `id`, `coins` | Fires when a user collects a coin. Note: Delayed Fire. If a player falls or glides by momentum through a coin, the coin event will only fire once the player moves again. Not good event for checking when a player touched a coin. |
| `blueCoinCollected`<sup>2</sup> | `id`, `blue_coins` |  | -->

- <sup>1</sup> This integer needs to be divided by 16 for downscale
- <sup>2</sup> This is a pseudo event (Created by the API for quality-of-life and not emitted by the game)

## Events: Send

| Event | Description |

| `.send(buffer[])` | Send raw binaries. |
| `.say(string)` | Write into chat |
| `.block(x, y, layer, id)` | Place a block |

| `.face(value)` | Change player face. |
| `.wait(time)` | Wait for a specific amount of time in miliseconds |
