 * The Connection class handles the lowest level of communication

 *
 * The Connection class handles the ping handshake with the server,
 * which is sending a ping byte response to every ping byte request
 * from the server.
 *
 * The events follow a hierarchic, layered structure. The bottom-most
 * layer is hidden within the `WebSocket` instance and cannot be
 * accessed.
 *
 * The Connection handles the second layer with the `Receive$1` events,
 * where `$1` is to be replaced with the distributions of the messages,
 * based on the first magic byte.
 *
 * Pings don't contain any information. Messages are transmitted
 * to the 3rd and top-most layer within another event emitter instance
 * that can be accessed with `receive()`
 *
 * Messages follow by their message type in 7-bit encoding. The events
 * are then broadcasted to the event emitter with the message name.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * Here is an example of a ping message being processed.
 *
 * ```
 * 1. Socket receives [MagicPing]
 * 2. 'ReceivePing' with rest buffer []
 * 3. 'send' is called with arguments. [MagicPing]
 * 4. Socket sends [MagicPing]
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 *
 * Here is an example of a more complex message being processed.
 *
 * ```
 * 1. Socket receives [MagicMessage, ChatMessage, 1, 'Hello, World!']
 * 2. 'ReceiveMessage' with rest buffer [ChatMessage, 1, 'Hello, World!']
 * 3. The upper-layer event 'ChatMessage' is emitted with rest buffer [1, 'Hello, World!']]
 * 4. Processing, assume we send 'Hi!' as a return
 * 5. Client 'send' is called with arguments event='ChatMessage' and arguments = ['Hi!]
 * 6. 'send' is called with arguments. [MagicMessage, ChatMessage, 'Hi!']
 * 7. Socket sends [MagicMessage, ChatMessage, 'Hi!']
 * ```
